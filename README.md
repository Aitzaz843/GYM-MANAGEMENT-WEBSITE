# GYM-MANAGEMENT-WEBSITE
In this project we make a webpage for gym management system.
#PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This is a Flask-based web application for a Gym Management System. The HTML template shown (aboutus.html) is part of a simple website that includes pages for:

Home

About Us

Membership

The layout and navigation indicate a small, informational site likely meant for a gym to showcase its offerings, trainers, and membership plans.
#Purpose
The Gym Management System website is designed to:

Inform users about the gym (About Us)

Provide access to membership information

Offer simple navigation across the site

The content suggests it could be expanded into a full system with user login, class booking, and trainer schedules.
